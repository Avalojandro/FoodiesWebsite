# Foodies Website elaniin FrontEnd Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Development server

The project needs the node_modules, so you must run `npm-install` to download it, then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project Website URL 
Go to https://foodieswebsite-f2129.web.app/ to watch the landing page running in a server

# Some details (IMPORTANT)
The website was deployed with Google Firebase, so the first time that you open the website you will see some errors with the animations and  images, to fix them, please refresh the page a few times.

## API issues (IMPORTANT)
+The images from the API url: `https://api.elaniin.dev/api/menu`, have an error 404, because the host of the images was expired or removed
<br>
+The API url from `https://api.elaniin.dev/api/locations` and `https://api.elaniin.dev/api/contact` redirects to `https://api.elaniin.dev` and don't show a JSON.
